# This is the repository for array processing
**Date: June 2022**  
**Student: Xuan Gao & Weijia Yi**  
## Project Description
### Project 1: Array parameter estimation
In this project, the goal is the estimate certain parameters from an array processing data model. The instruction document is [here](./instructions/ArrayParameterEstimation.pdf).
### Project 2: Speech enhancement
In this project, algorithms for speech enhancement are designed, implemented (in Matlab), evaluated, and documented. The physical outcome of the project is a technical report motivating the algorithm design and describing the implementation and evaluation of the algorithms. The instruction document is [here](./instructions/SpeechEnhancement.pdf).

## **How To Verify Our Work**
Please follow the steps below.  
### **Step 1**

```
git clone https://github.com/xuangao6/Speech-enhancement-ArrayProcessing.git
```
For codes, open `Array_parameter_estimation-1.m`,`Array_parameter_estimation-2.m`,and `speech-enhancement.m`.    

For reports, open `array_parameter_estimation.pdf` and `speech_enhancement.pdf` located at `.\reports`.

(for our daily unsorted codes, please find them at `.\Avocado-Price\daily update codes` folder)

### **Step 3**
Run codes, then you will get the same results as shown in our report.
